Check Balance
A method to which one -dimensional array and number n (may be positive or negative) are submitted
 to the input, while the method must shift all the elements of the array to the n positions.
 Elements are shifted cyclically. To complicate the task, it is impossible to use auxiliary arrays.
 Examples: [1, 2, 3] at n = 1 (per one to the right) -> [3, 1, 2]; [3, 5, 6, 1]
 with n = -2 (on two to the left) -> [6, 1, 3, 5]. At which n in which direction the shift can be chosen yourself.
